**Steps for Making Nasi Lemak:**

1. **Gather Ingredients:**
   - Rice (preferably jasmine or basmati)
   - Coconut milk
   - Pandan leaves
   - Salt
   - Eggs
   - Ikan bilis (dried anchovies)
   - Peanuts
   - Sambal (a spicy chili paste)
   - Cucumber
   - Optional: chicken, beef rendang, or fried fish

2. **Prepare Coconut Rice:**
   - Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear.
   - In a pot, combine the rice with coconut milk, water, pandan leaves, and a pinch of salt.
   - Cook the rice until it absorbs the liquid and is fully cooked. Fluff the rice with a fork.

3. **Prepare the Sambal:**
   - Blend chilies, garlic, shallots, and a bit of belacan (shrimp paste) to a smooth paste.
   - In a pan, heat oil, add the paste, and cook until fragrant.
   - Add sugar, salt, and tamarind juice, and cook until the sambal thickens.

4. **Prepare Accompaniments:**
   - Fry the ikan bilis and peanuts separately until crunchy.
   - Boil the eggs until hard-cooked, then peel and slice.
   - Slice the cucumber into thin rounds.
   - Cook any additional proteins (e.g., chicken, beef rendang).

5. **Assemble Nasi Lemak:**
   - Serve a portion of coconut rice on a plate.
   - Add a side of sambal, fried ikan bilis, peanuts, boiled egg, and cucumber slices.
   - Add additional proteins if desired.

**Recommendation for Improvement:**
To enhance the flavor profile of nasi lemak, ensure the pandan leaves are fresh and fragrant. Additionally, experimenting with different sambal recipes can lead to a signature taste that caters to personal or local preferences.
