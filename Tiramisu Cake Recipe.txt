**Steps for Making a Tiramisu Cake:**

1. **Gather Ingredients:**
   - Ladyfingers (Savoiardi)
   - Mascarpone cheese
   - Eggs
   - Sugar
   - Coffee (strong brewed)
   - Cocoa powder
   - Optional: dark rum or Marsala wine

2. **Prepare Coffee Mixture:**
   - Brew a strong pot of coffee. Add optional rum or Marsala if desired.

3. **Make Mascarpone Mixture:**
   - Separate egg yolks and whites.
   - Beat egg yolks with sugar until pale and thick.
   - Gently fold in mascarpone cheese until smooth.
   - Whip egg whites until stiff peaks form, then fold into the mascarpone mixture.

4. **Assemble Tiramisu:**
   - Dip each ladyfinger briefly into the coffee mixture (do not soak).
   - Arrange a layer of coffee-dipped ladyfingers in a dish.
   - Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers.
   - Repeat with another layer of coffee-dipped ladyfingers and remaining mascarpone.

5. **Chill:**
   - Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight, to allow flavors to meld and set.

6. **Serve:**
   - Before serving, dust the top with a generous layer of cocoa powder.
   - Slice and serve chilled.

**Recommendation for Improvement:**
To further improve the tiramisu, consider using high-quality mascarpone and freshly brewed espresso for a richer flavor. Adding a sprinkle of dark chocolate shavings can also enhance the dessert.
